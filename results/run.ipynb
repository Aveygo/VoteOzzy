      "Australian Labor Party -> Sarah is a 45-year-old nurse working in public healthcare, married with two children attending public school. She is a lifelong advocate for accessible, high-quality healthcare and affordable housing, driven by her experience seeing underfunded clinics and rising living costs strain her community. Sarah aligns with the Australian Labor Party because its policies directly address her priorities: expanding Medicare through bulk billing and urgent care clinics ensures her patients can access care without financial stress, while reducing prescription costs and opening specialized clinics like Endometriosis and Pelvic Pain centers reflect her belief in prioritizing women’s health. She supports Labor’s housing initiatives—such as the Help to Buy program, first home buyer incentives, and social housing upgrades—as critical to stabilizing her own family’s financial future and preventing housing insecurity. Sarah also values the party’s focus on education equity (free TAFE, student debt relief) and climate action (renewable energy targets, solar incentives), seeing these as investments in a fairer, more sustainable future. Her vote for Labor is rooted in trust that the party will protect public services, reduce inequality, and deliver tangible improvements for everyday Australians.\n",
      "Liberal Party of Australia -> Sarah is a 45-year-old small business owner and mother of two, who prioritizes economic growth, individual responsibility, and national security. She supports the Liberal Party’s policies for their focus on reducing public service spending to lower taxes and stimulate private sector innovation, which she believes will create jobs and boost the economy. Sarah backs increased domestic gas production and nuclear energy investment, seeing them as vital for energy independence and long-term economic stability. She advocates for reducing union power and restricting foreign investor influence to protect Australian industries and housing affordability. As a homeowner, she supports early superannuation access for house deposits and mortgage interest deductions for first home buyers, while also endorsing $5 billion in housing infrastructure funding to address affordability. Sarah is a strong proponent of tough knife and bail laws, as well as crackdowns on anti-Semitic protests and \"woke\" agendas in education, believing these measures safeguard traditional values and community safety. She also supports halving the fuel excise to ease household costs and bulk billing for GP visits to improve healthcare access. Her concerns about immigration and foreign student numbers stem from a belief that reducing these flows will ease pressure on public services and strengthen national identity. Sarah votes Liberal because she sees the party’s policies as a roadmap to a freer, more prosperous Australia where individuals and businesses can thrive without excessive government interference.  \n",
      "National Party -> Grant is a 55-year-old fourth-generation farmer and small business owner in Tamworth. He believes in strong regional economies and self-reliance, prioritizing agriculture and mining as pillars of rural livelihood. He supports the National Party’s focus on reducing living costs for regional Australians, such as increasing gas supply to lower energy prices and cracking down on supermarket price gouging through the Supermarket Commissioner and $2 million fines. Grant sees these policies as essential to protect local farmers and businesses from exploitation by big corporations. He also backs investments in regional infrastructure and healthcare, advocating for more GPs, specialists, and nurses to address the chronic shortages in rural areas. For Grant, the National Party’s agenda represents practical solutions to real problems: affordable energy, fairer pricing, and better access to services, all of which keep his community thriving. He’s skeptical of urban-centric policies and trusts the National Party to prioritize the needs of regional Australians over political theatrics.\n",
      "The Australian Greens -> Emma is a 38-year-old single mother and community activist deeply committed to environmental sustainability, social equity, and progressive reform. She prioritizes climate action, driven by her concern for her children’s future and the urgent need to combat climate change. She supports the Greens’ policies to declare a climate emergency, phase out fossil fuels, and transition to 100% renewable energy, which she believes will both protect the planet and reduce electricity costs for families. Emma advocates for expanded Medicare to include mental health services, dental care, and support for disabilities like ADHD and autism, as she has witnessed firsthand the financial and emotional strain these gaps create. A strong proponent of universal free childcare and education, she views these as essential to empowering working families and reducing inequality. Emma also champions policies to wipe HECS debt, reinstate free university access, and tax corporate greed, reflecting her belief in fairness and intergenerational justice. Her support for Indigenous rights includes backing the First Nations truth-telling commission and language preservation efforts, which she sees as critical to reconciliation. A vocal advocate for LGBTQIA+ rights and cannabis legalization, Emma rejects discrimination and supports lowering the voting age to 16 to foster youth engagement. Her opposition to corporate monopolies, such as breaking up Coles and Woolworths, stems from her frustration with exploitative practices that harm everyday Australians. Emma’s progressive values align with the Greens’ vision of a just, sustainable, and inclusive society.  \n",
      "Katter's Australian Party -> Darren is a 52-year-old farmer from rural Queensland, a self-described \"common-sense conservative\" who prioritizes law and order, economic independence, and traditional values. He believes in tough measures to combat youth crime, such as remote facility training for offenders and trying violent youth as adults, arguing these policies protect his community. A staunch supporter of fossil fuel industries, he backs restoring coal and gas power stations and investing in nuclear energy to create jobs and reduce reliance on foreign energy. Darren also champions policies like abolishing stamp duty and expanding the First Home Owners Grant to help locals buy land, while opposing supermarket monopolies to lower costs. He values responsible firearm ownership and landowner rights, such as managing crocodile populations, as tools for self-reliance. Darren distrusts \"elitist\" government overreach and sees Katter's Party as the only voice defending rural Australia’s interests, from economic freedom to cultural sovereignty for First Australians. His vote is driven by a desire to protect his way of life against what he views as unsustainable social policies and regulatory burdens.  \n",
      "Centre Alliance -> Emma is a small business owner and mother of two who prioritizes community growth and environmental sustainability. She supports Centre Alliance's policies to break up the Coles and Woolworths duopoly, as she believes smaller businesses and regional communities deserve fair competition and lower prices. She backs increased funding for regional health and transport, ensuring her town’s schools, hospitals, and families have access to reliable services. Emma is open to discussing nuclear power as a potential solution to energy insecurity but insists on strict safety and transparency standards. She advocates for affordable solar batteries to reduce household energy costs and end gambling ads to protect families from predatory marketing. A passionate environmentalist, she champions biodiversity protection and plastic reduction to safeguard her local ecosystem. Emma also pushes for more childcare funding based on need, preserving farmland to support local agriculture, and creating affordable housing for the elderly and disadvantaged to strengthen community resilience. Her loyalty to Centre Alliance stems from its focus on practical, progressive policies that address both regional challenges and national priorities.\n"
